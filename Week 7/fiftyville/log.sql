-- the theft took place on July 28, 2021 and that it took place on Humphrey Street.

-- As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
--I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- ten minutes after the theft the tief get into a car and drive away
